# An alternative to Git synchronisation is the "simple sync" mode. This will
# only back up your dashboards on the disk and won't do anything else.
# Here is an example of the synchronisation for the simple sync mode:
#
#   simple_sync:
#       sync_path: /etc/grafana-dashboards
#
# Note that if Git settings are supplied, the settings there will be used even
# if there are settings for the "simple sync" mode. In this case, if settings for
# the "simple sync" mode are supplied, they will be ignored by the configuration.
# Note also that the "simple sync" mode doesn't work with the pusher, which needs
# Git settings to work.


# Configuration for the Git -> Grafana pusher. Optional (only required if you
# try to run the pusher).
pusher:
    # Mode which will define how the pusher will sync with the Git remote.
    # Currently, only two modes are supported:
    #   webhook:    sets up a webhook which will listen for requests from the
    #               Git remote, and use the content of a request's body to
    #               determine what to push to Grafana. Currently only GitLab
    #               webhooks are supported.
    #   git-pull:   sets up a routine that will pull from the Git remote on a
    #               given interval, and compare the updated Git history with the
    #               previous one to determine what to push to Grafana.
    sync_mode: webhook
    # Configuration for the given sync mode. The current uncommented exemple
    # works for the "webhook" mode. Here's a config example for the "git-pull"
    # mode:
    #
    #   config:
    #       # Interval at which the remote should be pulled, in seconds.
    #       interval: 3600
    #
    config:
        # Interface the webhook will listen on.
        interface: 127.0.0.1
        # Port the webhool will listen on.
        port: 8080
        # Path on which the webhook will live. Full webhook URL will be
        # interface:port/path.
        path: /gitlab-webhook
        # Secret GitLab will use to authenticate the requests.
